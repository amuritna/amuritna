### Hello, I'm Emma!
- I'm currently an undergraduate student at Institut Teknologi Bandung.
- In addition to coding, things I like to do include doodling, taking walks, folding origami, reading fiction, and (if I'm not too tired) going on hikes.
- I have [a personal website](https://qua.name/amuritna/) and [a LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuella-rumanti/). I can also be reached via e-mail (amuritna at gmail dot com).
- Bonus fun fact: This isn't my first GitHub account.
